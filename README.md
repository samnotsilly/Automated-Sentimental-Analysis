## Inside the project

There are two main approaches to sentiment analysis. One is AFINN and another is VADER algorithm. We are using AFINN algorithm in this project. AFINN model which is dictionary-based algorithms.
AFINN is list of word rated for valence (the intrinsic attractiveness goodness (positive valence) or averseness badness (negative valence) of an event, object, or situation) with an integer between minus five and plus positive. Each word in the dictionary is associated with emotion.
AFINN is an algorithm that tokenize (breaking a row text into small chunks) a statement and rate each word with a negative score if it is negative, and a positive score if it is positive. Then we sum up the rating for the statement. The weighed result will show whether a statement has predominantly negative or positive words.
